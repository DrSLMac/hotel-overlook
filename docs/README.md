# üè∞ Welcome to The Claymore House üè∞
## Where Ancient Tradition Meets Modern Luxury
### F√†ilte gu Alba! (Scottish Gaelic for "Welcome to Scotland!")

## Introduction
The Overlook Project was a solo assignment for Turing School of Software and Design. This site allows a user to log in and book hotel rooms based on date and room type preferences. It also allows the guest to see previous rooms booked and total money spent on hotel bookings in this hotel.

The biggest win in this project was being able to figure out the fetch API and being able to post bookings to the site. The biggest challenge was being able to keep the functions and classes organized to know all that I was working with. This project was significantly larger and more complex than any of the previous works, so completing it was a rewarding accomplishment.
 
## Learning Goals
- Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
- Work with an API to send and receive data
- Solidify the code review process
- Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

## Technologies
 - Javascript
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - Fetch API
 - LightHouse (accessibility)
 - Mocha
 - Chai
 - Webpack
 - NPM

## Features
- When the guest loads the page, they will see a login page that will ask for their unique username and password. For this application, guests can log in with a username of customer1 - customer50, and the master password is "overlook2021."
- From there, the guest will be able to access their dashboard, view all hotel bookings, as well as total amount of money spent on bookings. 
- The guest will be able to book a new hotel room by clicking the "Make A New Reservation" button, which will take the guest to another page. This page will allow the guest to filter the available hotel rooms by date and room type.
- Once they find rooms available by filter, they will be able to book the room.
- They can click the "Return to Dashboard" button, which will take them back to the main dashboard, where they will not only see all booking, but will be able to see the upcoming booking that were just made.
